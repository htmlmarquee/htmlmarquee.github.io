<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="5">As a result of these all-night bacchanals, exceedingly little was accomplished on the twenty-second day of November; half the customary exercises were forgot, at dinner Messieurs appeared to be in a daze, and it was not until coffee they began to come somewhat to their senses</marquee>
<marquee scrollamount="10">      <marquee scrollamount="20" width="25%">"The coffee was served them by Rosette and Sophie, Zélamir and Giton"</marquee>    </marquee>
<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="7">In an effort to return to his usual old self, Curval had Giton shit, and the Duc swallowed Rosette's turd; the Bishop had himself sucked by Sophie, Durcet by Zélamir, but no one discharged</marquee>
<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="7">They moved dutifully into the auditorium; the matchless Duclos, weak and queasy after the preceding day's excesses, took her place with drooping eyelids, and her tales were so brief, they contained so few episodes, were recounted so listlessly, that we have taken it upon ourselves to supply them, and in the reader's behalf to clarify the somewhat confused speech she made to our friends</marquee>

<marquee scrollamount="10">      <marquee scrollamount="20" width="25%">"In keeping with prescription, she recounted five passions: the first was that of a man who used to have his ass frigged with a tin dildo priorly charged with warm water, the which liquid was pumped into his fundament at the same instant he ejaculated; nothing else was required to obtain that effect, he needed no one else's ministry"</marquee>    </marquee>

<marquee scrollamount="10">      <marquee scrollamount="20" width="25%">"The second man had the same mania, but was wont to use a far greater number of instruments; initially, he called for a very minute one, then gradually increased the caliber, ascending the scale by small fractions of an inch until he reached a weapon with the dimensions of a veritable fieldpiece, and only discharged upon receiving a torrent from its muzzle"</marquee>    </marquee>

<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="9">Far more of the mysterious was required to please the third one's palate: at the outset of the game, he had an enormous instrument introduced into his ass, then it was withdrawn, he would shit, would eat what he had just rendered, and next he had to be flogged</marquee>
<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="5">The flogging administered, it was time to reinsert the formidable device in his rectum, then once again it was removed, and it was the whore's turn to shit, and after that she picked up the whip again and lashed him while he munched what she had done; a third time, yes, a third time the instrument was driven home, and that, plus the girl's turd he finished eating, was sufficient to complete his happiness</marquee>

<marquee scrollamount="10">      <marquee scrollamount="20" width="25%">"In her fourth tale, Duclos made mention of a man who would have all his joints bound with strings; in order to make his discharge even more delicious, his neck itself was compressed, and, half choking, he would shoot his fuck squarely at the whore's asshole"</marquee>    </marquee>

<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="6">And in her fifth, she referred to that individual who used to tie a slender cord tightly to his glans;</marquee>
<img src="./gifs/227n.gif"></img>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="7">the girl, naked, would pass the other end of the cord between her thighs, and walk away from him, drawing the cord taut and offering the patient a full view of her ass; he would then discharge</marquee>

<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="6">Truly exhausted after having fulfilled her task, the storyteller begged to leave to retire, and she was allowed to</marquee>
<marquee scrollamount="10">      <marquee scrollamount="20" width="25%">"A few moments were devoted to uttering smutty comments upon this and that, and then the four libertines went to supper, but everyone felt the effects of our two principal actors' disorderliness"</marquee>    </marquee>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="7">At the orgies they were also as prudent and restrained as 'twere possible for such debauchees to be, and the entire household went more or less quietly to bed</marquee>
