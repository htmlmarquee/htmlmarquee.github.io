<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="8">These two articles were withdrawn, and replaced by twice the former quantity of fowl and game</marquee>

<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="5">Setting aside all idiosyncrasy for a moment, I most willingly grant you that he who requires stinking breath and a foul mouth is moved by depravation only, but for your part you must grant me that a mouth entirely bereft of odor gives not the slightest pleasure when kissed</marquee>
<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="7">There must always be some kind of spice to the thing, some flavor there, for where's the joy if it's not stung alive? the joy's asleep, I say, and it's only waked by a little filth</marquee>

<marquee style="color:#69e84f" bgcolor="#9617B0" direction="right" scrollamount="4">Give a somewhat greater degree of strength to the impulse and you'll want that mouth to be impure</marquee>
