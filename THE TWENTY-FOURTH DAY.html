<marquee style="color:#85c158" bgcolor="#7A3EA7" direction="right" scrollamount="5">Piety is indeed a true disease of the soul</marquee>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="6">Apply whatever remedies you please, the fever will not subside, the patient never heals; finding readier entry into the souls of the woebegone and downtrodden, because to be devout consoles them for their other ills, it is far more difficult to cure in such persons than in others</marquee>
<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="6">Such was the case with Adelaide: the more that vista of debauchery and of libertinage unfolded before her eyes, the more she recoiled and sought sanctuary in the arms of that comfort-giving God she hoped one day would come and deliver her from the evils which, she saw only too well, her dreadful situation was going to bring down upon her head</marquee>
<marquee style="color:#a9aa36" bgcolor="#5655C9" direction="right" scrollamount="6">No one had a more profound appreciation of her circumstances than she; her mind could not more clearly have foreseen everything that was necessarily to follow the fatal beginning of which already she had been a victim, however mildly; she wonderfully well understood that, as the stories grew progressively stronger, the men's use of her and of her companions, evolving sympathetically, would also grow more ferocious</marquee>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="7">All that, despite everything she was told, made her avidly seek out, as often and for as long as she could, the society of her beloved Sophie</marquee>
<marquee direction="down" scrollamount="9" behavior="alternate" height="100">  <marquee behavior="alternate" scrollamount="5"><font size="6">No longer did she dare go in quest of her at night; her overseers were sharp-eyed, wary, and drastic steps had been taken to thwart any more of those escapades, but whenever she found herself free for an instant, she would fly to her soul mate, and upon this very morning of the day we are presently chronicling, having risen early from the Bishop's bed, where she had lain that night, she went into the young girls' quarters to chat with her dearest correspondent</font></marquee>  </marquee>

<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="6">The only favor she dared beg from her husband was to try to prevent Sophie from being punished; for Sophie, she argued, could not be guilty, since it had been she, Adelaide, who had come looking for her, not Sophie who had gone in search of Adelaide</marquee>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="9">Durcet said he would report the fact as he had observed it, would disguise nothing; no one is less apt to be melted than a punisher whose keenest interest lies in punishing</marquee>

<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="9">But as the law fixed the death penalty for this offense, and as Messieurs were disposed to amuse themselves yet a little longer with these ladies before taking the final step, they were content to summon them, to make them kneel, and to read them the article out of the ordinances applying to their case, drawing their attention to the grave risk they had just run in committing such a transgression</marquee>
<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="6">That done, their judges pronounced a sentence thrice as severe as the one which had been executed upon them the previous Saturday, they were forced to swear they would not repeat their crime, they were advised that, should the same thing occur again, they would have to endure the extreme penalty, and their names were inscribed in the register</marquee>
