<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="4">The lessons continued, they were executed upon the fuckers, and as the day produced no outstanding event until coffee, we will begin our account with that little rite</marquee>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="5">Coffee was served by Augustine, Zelmire, Narcisse, and Zéphyr</marquee>
<marquee style="color:#05d21f" bgcolor="#FA2DE0" direction="right" scrollamount="9">The thigh-fuckeries began again, Curval laid hands on Zelmire, the Duc on Augustine, and after having admired and kissed their pretty buttocks which, I truly don't know why, that day possessed a charm, an attraction, a blush of vermilion the friends had not hitherto remarked, after, I say, our libertines had thoroughly kissed and caressed those exquisite little asses, farts were elicited from them; the Bishop, who had Narcisse in his grip, had already procured himself some, Zéphyr's could be heard spluttering into Durcet's mouth—why not imitate them? Zelmire succeeded, but Augustine had striven with might and main, the Duc had threatened her with another Saturday martyrdom, with punishment as severe as what she had just suffered the day before, but strains and struggles, menaces and imprecations were all in vain, nothing emerged from the poor little creature, she was already in tears when a driblet at length appeared and satisfied the Duc who inhaled the aroma and, highly pleased with this mark of docility in the pretty child of whom he was so fond, he camped his enormous engine between her thighs, then withdrew it as he was about to discharge, and totally inundated her two buttocks</marquee>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="4">Curval had done the same to Zelmire, but the Bishop and Durcet contented themselves with what is known as the little goosing; later, their nap over, they passed into the auditorium, where the splendid Duclos, arrayed that day in everything that could most successfully cause an observer to forget her age, appeared even lovelier under the candlelight, and our libertines, grown very hot with much looking at her, were loath to allow her to ascend to the platform without first having her exhibit her buttocks to the assembly</marquee>

<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="6">The reflection was a most simple one: I remarked the lamentable condition of my purse, and straightway was set to thinking</marquee>

<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="6">disbursed very little, I now found myself without even a hundred louis; that woman, extremely clever and never once deaf to the pleading of her own welfare, always found a way to pocket two-thirds of the house's receipts and to impose additional deductions upon the remainder</marquee>
<marquee style="color:#3618d5" bgcolor="#C9E72A" direction="right" scrollamount="7">These practices displeased me and, subject to repeated solicitations from another procuress, Madame Fournier, who wanted nothing more than to have me settle down with her, and knowing that this Fournier received elderly debauchees of a higher tone and greater means than Guérin's clientele, I decided to take my leave of the one and throw in my lot with the other</marquee>
<marquee direction="down" scrollamount="9" behavior="alternate" height="100">  <marquee behavior="alternate" scrollamount="4"><font size="6">As for the event which lent support to my ideas, it was the loss of my sister: I had grown very attached to her, and I could no longer remain in a house where everything reminded me of her but whence she was absent</font></marquee>  </marquee>

<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="8">For nearly six months that dear sister had been receiving visits from a tall, dark, and silent man whose face I found exceedingly disagreeable</marquee>
<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="4">They would retire together, and I do not know how they passed their time, for never did my sister want to discuss what they did, and never did they cavort in a place where I could view their commerce</marquee>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="8">In any event, she came into my room one fine morning, embraced me, and said that her fortune was made, she was to be the mistress of the tall man I disliked, and I learned only that the deciding factor in her conquest was the beauty of her buttocks</marquee>
<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="4">And with that she gave me her address, settled her accounts with Guérin, gave each of us a farewell kiss, and left</marquee>

<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="5">When I related the thing to Guérin and complained of what had happened, a malign smile crept over her face</marquee>
<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="9">She refused to explain herself; hence I concluded she was embroiled in this mysterious adventure but did not want me to become involved in it</marquee>
<marquee style="color:#ef9aec" bgcolor="#106513" direction="right" scrollamount="7">It all had a deep effect upon me and brought a swift end to my unresolve; as, Messieurs, I shall have no occasion to speak of that beloved sister in future, I may say now that, notwithstanding the inquiries I had made and the lengths to which I went to find her, I was never able to discover what had become of her</marquee>

<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="7">I sucked as best I could; he had my pucelage, he licked, bubbled, splashed about and, without doubt, in all these maneuvers, labored infinitely more in his own behalf than in mine</marquee>
