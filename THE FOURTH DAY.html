<marquee style="color:#852f49" bgcolor="#7AD0B6" direction="right" scrollamount="9">Colors were thereupon chosen: the Duc adopted pink and green: whosoever should wear a pink ribbon to the fore, would be his by the cunt; similarly, whosoever wore a green ribbon to the rear, would be his by the ass</marquee>

<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="8">Dinner, at which his conduct and remarks were very libertine indeed, calmed him not one whit, and the coffee served by Colombe, Sophie, Zéphyr, and his dear friend Adonis, set his brain all afire</marquee>
<marquee style="color:#625bd1" bgcolor="#9DA42E" direction="right" scrollamount="9">He laid hands on this selfsame Adonis, tumbled him onto a sofa, and while spewing forth oaths slid his enormous member between the lad's thighs (approaching him from behind), and as that outsized tool protruded a fair six inches beyond, he commanded Adonis vigorously to frig what emerged, and himself set to frigging the boy above the morsel of flesh upon which Adonis was spitted</marquee>

<marquee style="color:#e9377a" bgcolor="#16C885" direction="right" scrollamount="6">But doubtless fatigued by some nocturnal exercise, he showed not one spark of life, and like all other libertines rendered unjust by caprice and disgust, he lashed out furiously against these two delicious children, blaming them for the only too well merited shortcomings of his debilitated frame</marquee>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="6">Messieurs nap for a few minutes; then 'tis story-telling time, and in they troop to listen to the amiable Duclos, who resumes her tale in the following manner: There had been a few changes in Madame Guérin's house, said our heroine</marquee>
<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="8">Two very pretty girls had just found dupes who were only too willing to keep them and whom they deceived just the way we all do</marquee>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="4">To fill the gaps in the ranks, our dear mother had scouted around and set her sights upon a rue Saint-Denis tavern-keeper's daughter, thirteen years old and one of the most fetching creatures in all the wide world</marquee>
<marquee style="color:#accae4" bgcolor="#53351B" direction="right" scrollamount="6">But the little lady, quite as well-behaved as she was pious, was successfully resisting all enticements when Guérin, having one day employed the cleverest stratagem to lure her to her house, immediately put her in the hands of the unusual person whose mania I propose to describe next</marquee>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="4">He was an ecclesiastic of fifty-five or fifty-six, but so youthful and vigorous you'd have thought him under forty</marquee>
<marquee style="color:#fd9942" bgcolor="#0266BD" direction="right" scrollamount="4">No man in Europe had such a singular talent for drawing young girls into vice, and as it was his one art, developed to a sublime degree, he had turned it into his one and only pleasure</marquee>
<marquee scrollamount="10">      <marquee scrollamount="20" width="25%">"The whole of his fleshy delight consisted in extirpating childhood prejudices and unnatural terrors, in cultivating scorn for virtue, in decking vice in the most dazzling colors"</marquee>    </marquee>
<marquee style="color:#7316bd" bgcolor="#8CE942" direction="right" scrollamount="7">He neglected nothing: seductive images, flattering promises, delicious examples, he would press everything into service, everything would be brilliantly manipulated, his artistry being faultlessly attuned to the child's age and cast of mind, and never did he miss the mark</marquee>
<marquee style="color:#9a2f32" bgcolor="#65D0CD" direction="right" scrollamount="5">Granted a mere two hours of conversation, he was sure to make a whore of the best-behaved and most reasonable little girl; for thirty years he had been conducting his missionary labors in Paris, and, he had once assured Madame Guérin, who counted herself one of his best friends, he had to his credit more than ten thousand girls whom he had personally seduced and plunged into libertinage</marquee>
<marquee scrollamount="10">      <marquee scrollamount="20" width="25%">"He rendered similar services to at least fifteen procuresses, and whenever he was not coping with a particular problem at someone else's behest, he was busy doing research for its own sake and for his professional pleasure, energetically corrupting whatever he came across and then packing it off to his outfitters"</marquee>    </marquee>
<marquee style="color:#9c2cb6" bgcolor="#63D349" direction="right" scrollamount="7">Now, the most extraordinary aspect of the entire thing, and the one which, Messieurs, prompts me to cite the example of this uncommon individual, was that he never enjoyed the fruit of his labors</marquee>
<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="7">He would encloset himself alone with the child, but, despite his vast understanding, his mind's agility, his eloquent persuasiveness, he used always to emerge from conference greatly inflamed</marquee>

<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="6">Closest scrutiny had never revealed anything but a prodigious blaze in his stare when once he had concluded his speeches, a few twitching movements of his hand upon the front of his breeches, within which one could tell there was a definite erection, produced by the diabolic work he was doing; but that was all</marquee>

<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="9">Not long afterward, he rose, the child stretched forth her arms as if seeking to embrace him, he kissed her in a grave and fatherly manner, without any trace of lechery</marquee>

<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="9">He wanted me to accost men and frig them six inches from his face while he hid under a pile of folding chairs; and after I had frigged seven or eight passers-by, he settled himself upon a bench by one of the most frequented of the paths, lifted my skirts from behind, and displayed my ass to all and sundry, put his prick in the air and ordered me to frig it well within view of half of Paris, the which, although it was night, created such a scandal that by the time he most cynically unleashed his fuck, more than ten people had gathered around us, and we were obliged to dash away to avoid being publicly covered with shame</marquee>
