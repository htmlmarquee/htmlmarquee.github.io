And, as a matter of fact, there was shit everywhere to be had indeed, for, from fear of some temptation to wash, the governesses had removed every pot, every receptacle, every towel, and all water</marquee>

<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="4">A man of whose circumstances and existence I had not previously known anything, she said, and about whom I was later to learn only a little, and, therefore, a man about whom I can give you no better than an imperfect portrait, sent me a note, and in it besought me to come to his house, in the rue Blanche-du-Rempart, at nine o'clock in the evening</marquee>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="4">I had no reason to be suspicious, his note said; although I had no acquaintance of him, I could be certain that neither would I have cause to complain were I to come as he bade me do</marquee>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="7">Two louis accompanied the letter, and despite my usual cautiousness, which ought certainly to have opposed my accepting the invitation of a man of whom I knew nothing, despite all that, I took the risk, trusting to I know not what intuition which, in a very low voice, told me I had nothing to fear</marquee>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="7">And so I went; and I arrived at the given address</marquee>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="8">I am greeted by a valet who informs me that I am to undress entirely, for, he explains, it is only if I am naked that he can introduce me into his master's apartment; I execute the order, and directly he sees me in the state desired, he takes me by the hand, and having led me through several intervening chambers, finally knocks upon a door</marquee>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="6">It opens, I enter, the valet withdraws, the door closes again; but, with what regards the amount of light in the room, there was precious little difference between that place and the inside of a hat, neither light nor air penetrated into that room from any opening whatever</marquee>

<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="5">Wherewith his brutalities cease, he leads me to an elevated sofa, and has me stretch out flat upon it; then seating himself between my parted legs, he falls to doing to my buttocks what he has just left off doing to my breasts: he palpates and squeezes them with unparalleled violence, he spreads them, compresses them again, kneads them, mauls, kisses, and bites them, he sucks my asshole, and as these reiterated attacks were less dangerous on that side than they might have been on the other, I held my peace and put up no resistance, and as I let him toil over my</marquee>

<marquee style="color:#a4d996" bgcolor="#5B2669" direction="right" scrollamount="6">As you may readily imagine, my first movement was to leap to my feet; I spied a feeble glimmer of light—it was coming through the doorway I had entered—I dashed toward it—ran into the valet who had received me at the door—flung myself into his arms… He gave me back my clothes, also gave me two louis , I left the place at once, very pleased to have got off so cheaply</marquee>

<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="6">But what use did that wretched libertine design to make of both my breasts and my face? He had me lie down, entirely naked, upon a divan, straddled my chest, deposited his prick between my dugs, ordered me to squeeze them together as tightly as I was able, and after a brief career, the wicked fellow inundated them with fuck while expectorating at least twenty mouthfuls of thick spittle, all of which landed on my face</marquee>

Come, come, my dear Duclos, a man's life is something of such slight importance that one may sport with it as much as one likes, just as one might with a cat's life or with that of a dog; 'tis up to the feeble and weak to defend themselves, they have virtually the same weapons we possess"</marquee>    </marquee>
