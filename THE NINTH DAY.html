<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="5">That morning Duclos expressed her opinion, saying she held it prudent either to offer the little girls new patients to replace the fuckers then being employed in the masturbation exercises, or to terminate their lessons, for she believed their education sufficiently advanced</marquee>
<marquee style="color:#c43634" bgcolor="#3BC9CB" direction="right" scrollamount="4">Duclos very astutely pointed out that by continued use of the young men known by their title of fucker, there might result that species of intrigue Messieurs wished especially to prevent; moreover, she added, for such exercises these young men were worth nothing at all; since they were prone to discharge immediately after they were touched, their skittishness or incontinence ought certainly be better exploited, Messieurs' asses had only to lose if the program remained unchanged</marquee>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="6">It was therefore decided that the lessons would cease; they had generally succeeded, there were already amongst the little girls a few who frigged masterfully: Augustine, Sophie, and Colombe could easily have been matched, what for skill and nimbleness of wrist, against the capital's most famous friggers</marquee>
<marquee scrollamount="10">      <marquee scrollamount="20" width="25%">"Of them all, Zelmire was least adept: not that she lacked agility or that considerable science was not conspicuous in all her motions, no, but it was her tender and melancholic character which stood in her way, she seemed unable to forget her sorrows, she was sad and pensive at all times"</marquee>    </marquee>
<marquee direction="down" scrollamount="5" behavior="alternate" height="100">  <marquee behavior="alternate" scrollamount="6"><font size="6">At that morning's breakfast inspection tour, her duenna affirmed she had the previous evening caught the child in a prayerful attitude, flagrantly on her knees before retiring; Zelmire was summoned, questioned, she was asked the subject of her prayers; she at first refused to answer, then, threats having been employed, she fell to weeping and admitted she had besought God to deliver her from the perils wherewith she was beset, and had above all prayed that help would come before her virginity were lost</font></marquee>  </marquee>
<marquee style="color:#69fddc" bgcolor="#960223" direction="right" scrollamount="4">The Duc thereupon declared she deserved to die, and made her read the articles which dealt specifically with this subject</marquee>

<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="7">The three others were similarly sucked one after the other, but yielded nothing, and after the usual visit to the boys' quarters and the excursion to the chapel, which that morning produced little because almost everyone had been refused permission to join the party, the meal was served, and then Messieurs entered the salon for coffee</marquee>

<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="4">It was served by Fanny, Sophie, Hyacinthe, and Zélamir; Curval fancied he might thigh-fuck Hyacinthe, and obliged Sophie to post herself in such a way as to be able to suck that length of his prick which protruded beyond Hyacinthe's tightly squeezed legs</marquee>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="4">The scene was pleasant and inspiriting, he frigged the little chap he held hugged to his belly, and Hyacinthe discharged upon Sophie's face; the Duc, who owing to the dimensions of his prick was the only other one who could imitate this performance, likewise arranged himself with Zélamir and Fanny, but the lad had not yet reached the discharging age, and thus the nobleman had to do without the very agreeable episode Curval considered so enjoyable</marquee>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="5">After they had finished, Durcet and the Bishop took charge of the four children and had themselves sucked, but no one discharged, and after a brief nap, the company moved into the auditorium where, everyone having assumed his place, Duclos went on with her disclosures</marquee>

<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="4">Once we had all done our duty, he would button up again and go off in great haste, taking that freight with him</marquee>
