<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="9">His prick rebelled at last, dressed its lofty head, and the Duc saw very clearly that the homage required some incense after all</marquee>

<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="9">But Curval did not discharge, and withdrawing his proud and mettlesome engine from the Duc's bum, he menaced the Bishop, who was likewise frigging himself between Giton's thighs, threatening to make him undergo the fate the Duc had just experienced</marquee>
<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="5">The Bishop hurls a challenge, 'tis accepted, battle is joined, the Bishop is embuggered and, between the thighs of the pretty child he is caressing, goes on deliciously to lose a draught of libertine fuck most deliciously wheedled out of him</marquee>

<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="8">Each friend had his wife on his couch that day; they exchanged congratulations upon that very religious arrangement, and everyone being ready to listen, Duclos resumed her lewd stories</marquee>
