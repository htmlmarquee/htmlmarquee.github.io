<marquee style="color:#7b3e4b" bgcolor="#84C1B4" direction="right" scrollamount="4">In that nothing was more delicious than meting out punishments, in that nothing prepared the way for so many pleasures, and those very sorts of pleasures Messieurs had mutually promised not to taste until in the stories mention thereof should permit fullest indulgence in them, the libertines sought by every imaginable means to trip the subjects into states of delinquency, and so procure themselves the joy of chastising their hapless victims; to this end, the friends, having convoked an extraordinary assembly that morning, their purpose being to deliberate upon this problem, they added several articles to the household regulations, infraction of which was necessarily to occasion punishment</marquee>
<marquee style="color:#d17b04" bgcolor="#2E84FB" direction="right" scrollamount="9">Firstly, the wives, the small boys, and the girls were expressly forbidden to fart anywhere save in the friends' mouths</marquee>
<marquee style="color:#eacf9a" bgcolor="#153065" direction="right" scrollamount="7">Instantly they were seized by the desire to break wind, they were without delay to go and find one of the friends and administer unto him what required to be set at large; a severe afflictive penalty would be the reward for disobedience</marquee>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="7">Secondly, the use of bidets and ass-wipings of any kind were absolutely outlawed; it was generally proclaimed that all subjects without exception would hereafter never wash themselves, and never under any circumstances wipe the ass after having shitted; that, whenever an ass were found clean, upon the subject concerned would lie the burden of proving it had been licked clean by one of the friends, and that friend would have to be mentioned by name</marquee>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="7">In response to which citation, the friend would be questioned, and, being in a position to procure himself two pleasures, instead of only one, to wit: that of having cleaned the ass with his tongue, and that of having punished the subject who had afforded him this first pleasureâ€¦ Examples of this will be provided</marquee>
