<marquee direction="down" scrollamount="4" behavior="alternate" height="100">  <marquee behavior="alternate" scrollamount="9"><font size="6">Our heroes rose as bright and fresh as if they had just arrived from confession; but upon close inspection, one might have noticed that the Duc was beginning to tire a little</font></marquee>  </marquee>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="6">Blame for this could have been bestowed upon Duclos; there is no question but that the girl had entirely mastered the art of procuring him delight and that, according to his own words, his discharges were lubricious with no one else, which would corroborate the idea that these matters depend solely upon caprice, upon idiosyncrasy, and that age, looks, virtue, and all the rest have nothing whatever to do with the problem, that it all boils down to a certain tactfulness which is much more often found possessed by beauties in the autumn of life than by those others of no experience whom the springtide yet crowns with all her show</marquee>
<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="6"></marquee>
<img src="./gifs/558y.gif"></img>
<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="8">There was as well another creature in the company who was beginning to make herself very amiable and to attract considerable attention; we are referring to Julie</marquee>
<marquee style="color:#8c8e2d" bgcolor="#7371D2" direction="right" scrollamount="6">She was already announcing signs of imagination, debauchery, and of libertinage</marquee>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="8">Astute enough to sense that she stood in need of protection, clever enough to caress those very persons for whom perhaps she did not at heart have a very great fondness, she contrived to become Duclos' friend, this in order to try to achieve some favor in the eyes of her father upon the others</marquee>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="9">Every time her turn came to lie with the Duc, she would adopt Duclos' techniques and emulate them so successfully, give proof of such skill, so much consideration, that the Duc was always sure of obtaining delicious discharges whenever he used those two creatures to procure them</marquee>
<marquee scrollamount="10">      <marquee scrollamount="20" width="25%">"Nevertheless, his enthusiasm for his daughter was waning prodigiously, and perhaps without Duclos' assistance, for the narrator consistently spoke well in her behalf, she would never have been able to occupy a place in his good graces"</marquee>    </marquee>
<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="5">Her husband, Curval, was roughly of the same mind regarding her, and although, by means of her impure mouth and kisses, she still managed to wheedle a few discharges from him, disgust was dangerously near to becoming his predominating attitude toward her: one might even have said that the fires of his hostility were fanned by her impudicious caresses</marquee>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="6">Durcet held her in no esteem, she had not made him discharge more than twice since the adventures at Silling had started</marquee>
<marquee scrollamount="10">      <marquee scrollamount="20" width="25%">"And so it seemed that no one but the Bishop remained to her, and he indeed was fond of her libertine jargon, and judged hers to be the world's finest ass; and it is certain that Nature had furnished her with one as lovely as that which had been given to Venus"</marquee>    </marquee>
<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="4">She hence made the most of that part, for she wished absolutely to please at whatever the price; as she felt an extreme need for a protector, she sought to cultivate Duclos</marquee>

<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="8">After the three subjects had ridded themselves of their freight, Durcet was taken by an impulse to be delivered of his</marquee>

<img src="./gifs/182k.gif"></img>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="7">had been fluttering and buzzing about the financier's behind, seized the opportunity to satisfy himself and, sending away everyone but Constance, whom they kept as an aide, they encloseted themselves in the chapel</marquee>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="7">The Duc was appeased by the generous mouthful of shit he had from Durcet; these gentlemen, however, did not limit themselves to that prelude, and afterward Constance reported to the Bishop that they had performed infamies for a good thirty minutes</marquee>
<marquee style="color:#5dbf3c" bgcolor="#A240C3" direction="right" scrollamount="5">But what is one to expect? they had been friends, as I have said, since childhood, and since then had never ceased reminding one another of their schoolboy pleasures</marquee>
<marquee scrollamount="10">      <marquee scrollamount="20" width="25%">"As for Constance, she served no great purpose during this tête-à-tête; she wiped asses, sucked and frigged a few pricks, and that was about all"</marquee>    </marquee>

<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="9">It was, as usual, splendid and libertine and, after some lewd fingerings and bawdy colling, and a few scandalous remarks which spiced their lascivious byplay, they returned to the salon where Zéphyr and Hyacinthe, Michette and Colombe were waiting to serve coffee</marquee>
<marquee direction="down" scrollamount="4" behavior="alternate" height="100">  <marquee behavior="alternate" scrollamount="8"><font size="6">The Duc thigh-fucked Michette, and Curval, Hyacinthe; Durcet fetched shit out of Colombe, and the Bishop dropped some in Zéphyr's mouth; Curval, recollecting one of the passions Duclos had related the day before, was moved to shit in Colombe's cunt; old Thérèse, who was supervising the day's quartet, placed Colombe in a suitable posture, and Curval performed</font></marquee>  </marquee>
<marquee style="color:#e391be" bgcolor="#1C6E41" direction="right" scrollamount="9">But as he produced colossal turds, proportioned by the immense quantity of victuals wherewith he stuffed himself every day, almost all of his creation spilled upon the floor and it was, so to speak, only superficially he beshitified that pretty little virgin cunt which had not, one would have thought, been intended by Nature to be used for such disagreeable pleasures</marquee>

<marquee style="color:#a25079" bgcolor="#5DAF86" direction="right" scrollamount="7">He was given a large glass of elixir whereby they hoped his faculties would be restored, Michette and Colombe settled him upon a sofa for his nap and stood by him while he slept</marquee>
<marquee scrollamount="10">      <marquee scrollamount="20" width="25%">"He woke amply refreshed and, in order to give him additional strength, Colombe sucked him for a moment or two; his engine responded by showing some positive signs of life, and they went next into the auditorium"</marquee>    </marquee>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="7">The Bishop had Julie on his couch; as he was rather fond of her, the sight of her improved his mood</marquee>

<marquee scrollamount="10">      <marquee scrollamount="20" width="25%">"The occasion arrived in this way: the poor shoemaker, married to a girl of his own class and sort, had, as the unique fruit of this unfortunate marriage, a daughter of about twelve; I had been to told that, together with all the lovely features of childhood, she possessed all the attributes of the most tender beauty"</marquee>    </marquee>
<marquee style="color:#94d51e" bgcolor="#6B2AE1" direction="right" scrollamount="4">This child, then being brought up humbly but nevertheless as carefully as the parents' indigence could permit, for she was the joy and light of their life, this child, I say, struck me as a capture well worth making</marquee>

<img src="./gifs/326q.gif"></img>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="7">Petignon had never come to the house, he knew nothing of the legal rights that were his; immediately after Fournier had mentioned him to me, my first move was to obtain information about him and those around him, and thus I learned that he possessed a treasure in his house</marquee>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="4">At about the same time the Comte de Mesanges came to me; a famous libertine of whose profession Desgranges will doubtless have at least one occasion to speak, the Comte requested me to provide him with a maid of no more than thirteen at whatever the price</marquee>
<marquee style="color:#701a9f" bgcolor="#8FE560" direction="right" scrollamount="4">I don't know what he wanted with the article, for he passed for a man with very rigorous scruples when it was a question of women, but his proposal was simple enough: after having, with the help of experts, established her virginity, he said he would buy her from me for a fixed sum and, from this moment on, she would be his, he would be her master, and, he added, the child would be removed, perhaps permanently, from France</marquee>
<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="4"></marquee>
<img src="./gifs/61a.gif"></img>
<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="8">As the Comte was one of my habitués—you shall see him enter upon the scene very soon—I set everything in motion in an effort to satisfy him; Petignon's little daughter seemed to me exactly what he needed</marquee>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="9">But how was I to get my hands upon her? The child never left the house, it was there she received her education; so carefully was she supervised, so circumspectly that I began to despair of the prize</marquee>
<marquee style="color:#2ea250" bgcolor="#D15DAF" direction="right" scrollamount="5">Nor was I able to employ that masterful debaucher of girls I mentioned some time ago; he was away from the city, and the Comte was urging me to hurry</marquee>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="7">And so I could find only one means, and this means could not have been better designed to serve the secret little wickedness which was impelling me to commit this crime, for the crime was aggravated by it</marquee>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="9"></marquee>
<img src="./gifs/110o.gif"></img>
<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="6">I resolved to embroil husband and wife in some kind of difficulty, to strive to get both of them imprisoned, and in this way removing some of the obstacles between the child and myself, I fancied I would encounter no trouble in luring her into the snare</marquee>

<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="8">From then on everything was easy; an adroit scout accosted the little girl, who had been abandoned to the care of some poor neighbors, she was led to me</marquee>
<marquee scrollamount="10">      <marquee scrollamount="20" width="25%">"Her appearance perfectly matched the reports I had received: she had a sweet, a soft, a fair skin, the roundest little ornaments, charms perfectly shaped… In a word, it were difficult to find a prettier child"</marquee>    </marquee>

<img src="./gifs/137d.gif"></img>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="5">As she cost me, all told, about twenty louis , and as the Comte wished to pay a flat price for her and, having once bought her outright, wished neither to hear another word about the transaction nor have further dealings with anyone, I let her go for one hundred louis ; it being essential to my interests that no one get wind of my part in the thing, I was content with a net profit of sixty louis , given my attorney another twenty to create just that kind of stir which would prevent her parents from having news of their daughter for a long time</marquee>

<marquee style="color:#8c88c0" bgcolor="#73773F" direction="right" scrollamount="4">I reaped a twofold advantage from that little mishap, since it simultaneously assured me undisputed ownership of the child I was negotiating to sell and also assured me 60,000 francs for my trouble</marquee>
<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="6">As for the child, the Comte was satisfied with her; never did he encounter any difficulties, never did I, no, not a word was said, and it is more than likely Madame Desgranges will finish her story; I know no more about it</marquee>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="9">But it is high time to return to my own adventures, and to the daily events which may offer you the voluptuous details we have listed</marquee>
