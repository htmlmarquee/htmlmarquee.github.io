<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="7">Our heroes rose as bright and fresh as if they had just arrived from confession; but upon close inspection, one might have noticed that the Duc was beginning to tire a little</marquee>
<marquee scrollamount="10">      <marquee scrollamount="20" width="25%">"Blame for this could have been bestowed upon Duclos; there is no question but that the girl had entirely mastered the art of procuring him delight and that, according to his own words, his discharges were lubricious with no one else, which would corroborate the idea that these matters depend solely upon caprice, upon idiosyncrasy, and that age, looks, virtue, and all the rest have nothing whatever to do with the problem, that it all boils down to a certain tactfulness which is much more often found possessed by beauties in the autumn of life than by those others of no experience whom the springtide yet crowns with all her show"</marquee>    </marquee>

<marquee scrollamount="10">      <marquee scrollamount="20" width="25%">"There was as well another creature in the company who was beginning to make herself very amiable and to attract considerable attention; we are referring to Julie"</marquee>    </marquee>
<marquee direction="down" scrollamount="5" behavior="alternate" height="100">  <marquee behavior="alternate" scrollamount="8"><font size="6">She was already announcing signs of imagination, debauchery, and of libertinage</font></marquee>  </marquee>
<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="5">Astute enough to sense that she stood in need of protection, clever enough to caress those very persons for whom perhaps she did not at heart have a very great fondness, she contrived to become Duclos' friend, this in order to try to achieve some favor in the eyes of her father upon the others</marquee>
<marquee scrollamount="10">      <marquee scrollamount="20" width="25%">"Every time her turn came to lie with the Duc, she would adopt Duclos' techniques and emulate them so successfully, give proof of such skill, so much consideration, that the Duc was always sure of obtaining delicious discharges whenever he used those two creatures to procure them"</marquee>    </marquee>
<marquee style="color:#5dc830" bgcolor="#A237CF" direction="right" scrollamount="6">Nevertheless, his enthusiasm for his daughter was waning prodigiously, and perhaps without Duclos' assistance, for the narrator consistently spoke well in her behalf, she would never have been able to occupy a place in his good graces</marquee>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="7">Her husband, Curval, was roughly of the same mind regarding her, and although, by means of her impure mouth and kisses, she still managed to wheedle a few discharges from him, disgust was dangerously near to becoming his predominating attitude toward her: one might even have said that the fires of his hostility were fanned by her impudicious caresses</marquee>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="8">Durcet held her in no esteem, she had not made him discharge more than twice since the adventures at Silling had started</marquee>
<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="7">And so it seemed that no one but the Bishop remained to her, and he indeed was fond of her libertine jargon, and judged hers to be the world's finest ass; and it is certain that Nature had furnished her with one as lovely as that which had been given to Venus</marquee>
<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="7">She hence made the most of that part, for she wished absolutely to please at whatever the price; as she felt an extreme need for a protector, she sought to cultivate Duclos</marquee>

<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="4">The Duc was appeased by the generous mouthful of shit he had from Durcet; these gentlemen, however, did not limit themselves to that prelude, and afterward Constance reported to the Bishop that they had performed infamies for a good thirty minutes</marquee>
<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="5">But what is one to expect? they had been friends, as I have said, since childhood, and since then had never ceased reminding one another of their schoolboy pleasures</marquee>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="6">As for Constance, she served no great purpose during this tête-à-tête; she wiped asses, sucked and frigged a few pricks, and that was about all</marquee>

<img src="./gifs/137d.gif"></img>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="8">They retired to the salon, the four friends conversed there for a while, and the midday meal was announced</marquee>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="5">It was, as usual, splendid and libertine and, after some lewd fingerings and bawdy colling, and a few scandalous remarks which spiced their lascivious byplay, they returned to the salon where Zéphyr and Hyacinthe, Michette and Colombe were waiting to serve coffee</marquee>
<marquee scrollamount="10">      <marquee scrollamount="20" width="25%">"The Duc thigh-fucked Michette, and Curval, Hyacinthe; Durcet fetched shit out of Colombe, and the Bishop dropped some in Zéphyr's mouth; Curval, recollecting one of the passions Duclos had related the day before, was moved to shit in Colombe's cunt; old Thérèse, who was supervising the day's quartet, placed Colombe in a suitable posture, and Curval performed"</marquee>    </marquee>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="7">But as he produced colossal turds, proportioned by the immense quantity of victuals wherewith he stuffed himself every day, almost all of his creation spilled upon the floor and it was, so to speak, only superficially he beshitified that pretty little virgin cunt which had not, one would have thought, been intended by Nature to be used for such disagreeable pleasures</marquee>

<marquee style="color:#e4aa9b" bgcolor="#1B5564" direction="right" scrollamount="6">He was furious, he scolded Zéphyr, he scolded Curval, he fumed and grumbled at everyone</marquee>
<marquee style="color:#3cc10d" bgcolor="#C33EF2" direction="right" scrollamount="4">He was given a large glass of elixir whereby they hoped his faculties would be restored, Michette and Colombe settled him upon a sofa for his nap and stood by him while he slept</marquee>
<marquee scrollamount="10">      <marquee scrollamount="20" width="25%">"He woke amply refreshed and, in order to give him additional strength, Colombe sucked him for a moment or two; his engine responded by showing some positive signs of life, and they went next into the auditorium"</marquee>    </marquee>
<marquee scrollamount="10">      <marquee scrollamount="20" width="25%">"The Bishop had Julie on his couch; as he was rather fond of her, the sight of her improved his mood"</marquee>    </marquee>

<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="6">As the Comte was one of my habitués—you shall see him enter upon the scene very soon—I set everything in motion in an effort to satisfy him; Petignon's little daughter seemed to me exactly what he needed</marquee>
<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="6">But how was I to get my hands upon her? The child never left the house, it was there she received her education; so carefully was she supervised, so circumspectly that I began to despair of the prize</marquee>
<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="7">Nor was I able to employ that masterful debaucher of girls I mentioned some time ago; he was away from the city, and the Comte was urging me to hurry</marquee>

<marquee direction="down" height="100" scrollamount="5">I located a pretty little shopgirl of twelve or thirteen for the gentleman whom we are about to see in action; he arrives, has the girl take off only the clothing that covers her from the waist down; he toys with her behind for a brief moment, gets her to fart a little, then gives himself four or five copious enemas which, subsequently, he obliges his little partner to receive into her mouth and to swallow as the cascade tumbles out of his rectum</marquee>
