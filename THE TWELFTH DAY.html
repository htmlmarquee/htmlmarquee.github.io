<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="4">The new mode of life I was about to begin, said Duclos, obliges me to draw your attention, Messieurs, to my personal appearance and character at the time; one is better able to figure the pleasures being described if one is first acquainted with the object that procures them</marquee>
<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="8">I had just attained my twenty-first year</marquee>
<marquee scrollamount="10">      <marquee scrollamount="20" width="25%">"My hair was brown, but nevertheless my skin was of a most agreeable whiteness"</marquee>    </marquee>

<marquee style="color:#bbf046" bgcolor="#440FB9" direction="right" scrollamount="5">I had very little love for men, I had never had but one attachment; I had a libertine maid, but it was extraordinarily libertine, and after having described my charms it is only fitting that I say a word or two about my vices</marquee>

I don't believe I have ever in all my life wept over my troubles, and I can safely assure you I have never dropped a tear for the afflictions of others; I loved my sister, and I lost her without the least twinge of grief, you were witness to the stoic indifference with which I greeted news of her undoing; I would, by God, see the universe perish without a sniffle or a sigh</font></marquee>  </marquee>
